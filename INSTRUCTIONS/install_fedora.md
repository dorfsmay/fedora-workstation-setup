# Install Fedora
*Updated on 2023/10/11 for Fedora 38*

## Note about swap space
How much swap sapce do you need: short answer, use 8 GiB.

There isn't a universal long answer, unless you know you what hibernate is and you know you will use it, otherwise the answer varies from 8 GiB, to square root of physical memory to 20% of physical memory!

## How to check amount of physical memory during install
**If**, during the install, you wanted to know  how much memory is installed on your laptop, for example to decide on how much swap space to use, use the folloing steps:

* ctrl-alt-F1
* use root to login, no passwd
* `free -h` and note the total for Mem
* `exit`
* ctrl-alt-f2
